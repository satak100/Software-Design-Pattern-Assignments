## 📖 About Software Design Patterns
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. This repository explores three major categories:

### 🏗️ **Creational Design Patterns**
- Focus on **object creation mechanisms**.
- Examples: Factory Method, Singleton, Builder, Prototype.

### 🏛️ **Structural Design Patterns**
- Concerned with **class and object composition**.
- Examples: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator.

### 🎭 **Behavioral Design Patterns**
- Deal with **object interaction and responsibility**.
- Examples: Observer, Strategy, Command, State.
